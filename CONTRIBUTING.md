# Tests

Make sure your changes follow code style and pass basic suite of regression tests.

To install all dependencies into local directory named `node_modules` and run test suite, simply execute (Node 0.10):


```bash
npm install && npm test

```

By default tests (including GUI ones) run in headless mode under [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).
Local HTTP server is spawned automatically for the lifetime of test suite task.

To run test suite under a specific browser:

- `grunt firefox`
- `grunt chrome`

To start simple HTTP server manually:
(`yt.127.0.0.1.xip.io` should point to `127.0.0.1`)

- `grunt httpd`

To check code style:

- `grunt jshint`
